## Purpose
For anyone unfamiliar, Dota 2 is a very complicated competitive strategy game. It's often acknowledged around July each year for its pinnacle tournament's enormous prize pool. Unfortunately, the game is prohibitively difficult to learn - it has an enormous amount of information that has to be committed to memory to perform at a high level in the game. To help out with this learning curve, I wanted to help those new to the game by keeping necessary information at their fingertips when following online discussions, patch notes or analysis.

As a secondary purpose, this extension also helps to annotate many community acronyms or nicknames for the various characters and items in the game, allowing newcomers to follow veteran conversations without necessitating prior knowledge about the historical names of various elements from the game. 

## Release Status
Currently working to implement a settings menu and then release!
